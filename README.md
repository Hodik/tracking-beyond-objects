# tracking-beyond-objects

## Overview
This project aims to combine YOLO object detection, BotSort tracking, and spatial-temporal action detection to achieve advanced tracking capabilities. By leveraging the power of these techniques, the project aims to go beyond traditional object tracking and enable the detection and tracking of complex actions in videos.

## Features
- YOLO Object Detection: The project utilizes YOLO (You Only Look Once) algorithm for real-time object detection.
- BotSort Tracking: BotSort tracking algorithm is employed to track objects across frames and maintain their identities.
- Spatial-Temporal Action Detection: The project incorporates spatial-temporal action detection techniques to identify and track complex actions in videos.

## Installation
1. Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/tracking-beyond-objects.git
    ```
2. Install the required dependencies:
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

## Usage
1. Run the main script to start the tracking system:
    ```bash
    python main.py
    ```
2. Follow the on-screen instructions to provide input videos and configure the tracking parameters.
